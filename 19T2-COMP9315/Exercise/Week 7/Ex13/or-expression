Give mapping(s) to RA for

  select * from R where Cond1 or Cond2

Answer:

Sel[Cond1 or Cond2]R

Sel[Cond1]R U Sel[Cond2]R


Give RA expression(s) corresponding to

  select * from R where (a=1 or a=3) and b < c

One obvious possibility:

Sel[(a=1 or a=3) and b < c](R)

Others:

Sel[a=1 and b < c](R) U  Sel[a=3 and b < c](R)

Tmp = Sel[b < c]R
Res = Sel[a=1 or a=3]Tmp
