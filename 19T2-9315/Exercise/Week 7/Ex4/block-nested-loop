Compute the cost (# pages fetched) of (S â‹ˆ E)
Sym Meaning Value

rS      # student records       20,000
rE      # enrollment records    80,000
cS      Student records/page    20
cE      Enrolled records/page   40
bS      # data pages in Student 1,000
bE      # data pages in Enrolled 2,000
N       # memory buffers        22

N = 22, S as outer, 50 * 20-page chunks of S
1000 + 2000 * 50 = 101,000

N = 22, E as outer, 100 * 20-page chunks of E
2000 + 1000 * 100 = 102,000

N = 202, S as outer, 5 * 200-page chunks of S
1000 + 2000 * 5 = 1000 + 10000 = 11000

N = 202, E as outer, 10 * 200-page chunks of E
2000 + 1000 * 10 = 2000 + 10000 = 12000

N = 2002, S as outer, 1 * 2000-page chunk of S 
1000 + 2000 = 3000

N = 2002, E as outer, 2 * 1000-page chunks of E 
2000 + 1000 * 2 = 4000
