Quiz#4 Answers:

1. All of the other answers are correct translations

2. ABD, AC, BG, DEF

Detailed solution:

R=ABCDEFG
F= A->c, D->EF, B->G

key? ABD+ = ABCDEFG meaning ABD is a key

Is R in BCNF? No since A->C violates the rule

R1= ABDEFG
R2= AC  <-- this is in BCNF

R1=ABDEFG
F1= D->EF, B->G  key is ABD
R1 is not in BCNF since D->EF violates the rule

R11= ABDG
R12 = DEF

FDs for R12 is only F12= D->EF 
D is a key for R12  
R12 satisfies the rule so R12=DEF is in BCNF

FDs for R11 is only F11= B->G
key for R12 is ABD
B->g violates the rule

R112= ABD
R112= BG <--- BCNF since only two attributes

No FDs for R112=ABD meaning it is in BCNF

Conclusion:
AC, DEF, BG, ABD is a BCNF partitioning of the original set of attributes.
